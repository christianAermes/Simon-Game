# Simon-Game
This was a coding challenge on [freecodecamp.org](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/build-a-simon-game)

## What does it do?
You can play the game either in strict mode or in non-strict mode.
In strict mode, if you make a mistake in the sequence, a new game starts. In non-strict mode, if you make a mistake, the sequence plays again.
If you get to 20 correct turns, you win the game.

## What I learned
* basic CSS styling
* using jquery
